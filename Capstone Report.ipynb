    "To solve the above problem, we'll use the geopy's distance.distance function which calculates the distance between two geographical coordinates. We'll first search for the neighborhood in the price data and in case it doesn't exist(or has a different name) we'll instead calculate the distance of each coordinate in the price data to the neighborhood's coordinate and assign the price of the neighborhood which has passed some minimum threshold(for example if the neighborhood's coordinates is within 100 meters of the Price data's current row). \n",

The reason is that these neighborhoods are the most expensive of all the 91 Neighborhoods, yet they are also the    most popular ones for having a pizza! which seems contradictory as why would businesses operate in the most expensive   Neighborhoods!

    "There are several factors that determine the success of a business at a location. There can be different strategies to open a business. One strategy is to open a business in an area where there is little to no competition. This is a less risky way of setting up a new business since business won't be faced with problems such as intense competition and increasing the quality of the products at a very high rate to keep up with the increasing demands of the consumers and compete with rival firms. But, that also comes with a cost of building the consumer base from scratch which means almost no returns in the initial few months of setting up the business\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of businesses are the ones having an average or low real estate rates and very less competitors in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Dataframe Coffee Shops in Jasola, Kotwali, Nizzamudin West, Shakarpur are the examples of these kind of businesses where possible rent is very low and almost zero competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other strategy is to open a business where there are already big markets that are setup. These kind of businesses has the advantage of tapping into huge amount of consumers since the demand is already taken care of(as popular markets have large number of consumers). But, on the other hand it is a very risky strategy. The investment require to rent or buy real estate would be high. Also, due to the intense competition in these markets, the quality of the products should also be good otherwise the competition would be lost to other big businesses that are already selling in the market. This strategy is a high risk, high return strategy. Nonetheless, many other factors should also be considered before operating on these kind of neighborhoods(for example: assessing if it's even worth to spend that much money on the expensive shops)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhoods of Roshnara and Preet Vihar are some of the most expensive neighborhoods in Delhi but they're also one of those that have a good number of pizza shops.\n",
    "One way to answer this problem is that there are other factors present possibly emergance of big markets in those areas where large number of consumers shop which couldl make opening shops and restaurants in those areas profitable due to high sales.\n"
