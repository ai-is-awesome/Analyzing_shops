    "Since, the city falls under one of the most richest cities in India. People are willing to spend money on good food. Hence, there is abundant demand from people for good food.\n",

    "### *The business problem* that we're interested in is to find the neighborhoods of Delhi that does not have much eatries around. Also, to sort those neighborhoods according to the price / square feet to find the cheapest locations to open new restaurants / eatries or any different kind of shops\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main stake holders for this project will be Entrepreneurs or Restauranteurs looking to open shops in New Delhi. They will be able to access the competition of their rival restaurants and compare the competition with the prices of the neighborhood to make optimized decisions about which Neighborhood to choose in New Delhi to open a particular type of shop. \n"

    "After we have the Data with the geocoding coordinates available, we'll be using the foursquare's geogrpahic data to get the best venue of the neighborhood.\n",
    "We will be around half way into the project now.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, we'll also need a way to figure out how to match the neighborhood data of wikipedia page to the Neighborhood price data of makaan.com since all the neighborhood won't have the same name and there may be lots of neighborhoods who don't match up. \n",
    "To solve the above problem, we'll use the geopy's distance.distance function which calculates the distance between two geographical coordinates. We'll first search for the neighborhood in the price data and in case it doesn't exist(or has a different name) we'll instead calculate the distance of each coordinate in the price data to the neighborhood's coordinate and assign the price of the neighborhood which has passed some minimum threshold(for example if the neighborhood's coordinates is within 100 meters of the Price data's current row). \n",
